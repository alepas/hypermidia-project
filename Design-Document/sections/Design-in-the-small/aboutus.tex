\subsection{Contact Form}
The aim of this page is to let users ask questions or send messages to the association through a contact form, whose fields are all mandatory. \\
Once filled the form, Send button must be clicked:
\begin{itemize}
	\item if one or more fields are empty or if the email is invalid (being valid means that it has the following structure: 				\emph{example@example.com}) an error message will occur;
	\item if the form has been well completed a success message will pop up.
\end{itemize}
