Alessandra loves to watch documentaries about mountain environment and she is seriously scared by the fact that humans behaviour may affect and damage this fragile ecosystem. Because of these thought, she decides that it's time to give her contribute to save our wonderful world and she starts to search for associations that take care of wild animals and their environment. By surfing the net she ends up on our association's website. \\
She likes all read information and she is really excited because she is arrived to the conclusion that this is the association she was looking for. Because of this, she navigates to the FAQ section where she learns that to become a volunteer she needs to send a message to the association through the contact form.
