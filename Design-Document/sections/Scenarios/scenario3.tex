Stefano enjoys participating to some of the events organized by Wild Care sometimes. In particular, last week he took part in an event that offered a service about feeding animals and he really liked both the content of the service and the interactiveness with the volunteers involved.\\
He decides to experience that again with he's girlfriend, so he connects to the website and starts to looking for that service with the volunteers that was involved last time too. When he finds it, he navigate to the next event that will offer it and reads when it's going to take place.
