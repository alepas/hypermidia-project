\subsubsection{Interaction Consistency}
This website has a pretty consistent choice of interaction. Every page shares the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Header:} gives the possibility to change language, season and to access to the newsletter page (fig. 1) ;
	\item \textbf{Topbar:} allows a user to navigate between almost every website's page and content, it is the main navigation 		instrument (fig. 2); 
	\item \textbf{Leftbar:} allows a user to get important information such as weather, skilift 	situation, online skipass booking (fig. 		3);
	\item \textbf{Footer:} provides links to partners' websites, to its social network profiles and general informations such as 			contacts and privacy policies (fig. 4).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Group Navigation}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.2\textwidth}
    	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{./assets/dropdown-menu.png}
	\caption{Dropdown Men√π}
\end{wrapfigure} Thanks to the topbar (fig. 2) and the leftbar (fig. 3) a quick access is granted to almost all contents. Group navigation is also supported by topbar's dropdown menus (fig. 5), which contain the links to all main components of each group and helps the user to navigate between them. 

\subsubsection{Structural Navigation}
The various parts of a topic are organized in a list of items and each of them is represented by a title, a short description and almost always by an image; these elements make the structural navigation really intuitive and user friendly.


\subsubsection{Semantic Navigation}
Even though almost all contents can be accessed through the topbar, it is not possible to easily navigate between related contents because, except for some pages, similar contents aren't connect via a visible link on the page. 

\subsubsection{Landmarks}
Landmarks can be found into the header (fig. 1), the topbar (fig.2), the leftbar (fig. 3) and the footer (fig. 4). These elements do not change between different pages, but they could be more effective by adopting some graphic customization.
