	The aim of this document is to report the User-Testing-based Usability Evaluation of Wild Care website which can be found at 	\url{https://wild-care.herokuapp.com/}.	\\ The website that is analyzed into this document is intended to provide 				information about Wild Care association, the events that it organizes, the services provided and the volunteers that are 			involved into the association and its activities. It also gives the possibility to read faqs and to sent request via a form.\\

	%Execution
	\section{Execution of the study}
	The study has been executed in person at the end of the development of the website. The testers used their own laptop or 		our while we manually gather usability data. We took two tests at a time in parallel to reduce time and make it faster.	 In 			order to be sure that every tester didn't see the website before the execution we divided them in different rooms, who was 		doing the test was in one room with one of the developers and the others where waiting in the living room.\\ We have also 		chosen to respect our tester privacy and, for this reason, they are represented here through IDs.
